This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

super small text project to figure out Redux, specifically with RxJS & redux-observable

/actions houses all redux actions
/assets is for static assets
/components for react components
/epics is for RxJS (redux observable) epics
/reducers for redux reducers
/store for the redux store (which is ever only going to be one file, but was cleaner in it's own directory imo)
/styles for css (would be sass in production, didn't mess around to add that capability here for test purposes)

to run it yourself:

1) clone this repo
2) yarn (or npm install if you still don't use yarn)
3) npm start (still shorter than yarnpkg start)
